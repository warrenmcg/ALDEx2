Description: A differential abundance analysis for the comparison of
        two or more conditions. For example, single-organism and
        meta-RNA-seq high-throughput sequencing assays, or of selected
        and unselected values from in-vitro sequence selections. Uses a
        Dirichlet-multinomial model to infer abundance from counts,
        that has been optimized for three or more experimental
        replicates. Infers sampling variation and calculates the
        expected false discovery rate given the biological and sampling
        variation using the Wilcox rank test or Welches t-test
        (aldex.ttest) or the glm and Kruskal Wallis tests (aldex.glm).
        Reports both P and fdr values calculated by the Benjamini
        Hochberg correction.
